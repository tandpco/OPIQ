But it's imperative to get more specific. If the app is targeted at Road Warriors (business people that travel heavily) in the U.S. with links to U.S.-based travel and destinations sites, with app functionality that requires the use of location-based services, then the real addressable market is far smaller than $1 billion for a $1 app. And the market is even smaller if you are only focusing on one platform (such as the iPhone) as opposed to all smartphone platforms. See the example analysis below:</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">By the numbers:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li># of U.S. Road Warriors (heavy business travelers): &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 10.0 million (example data)</li>\r\n<li>Multiply by the % of Road Warriors that carry smartphones: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;x 95% (example assumption)</li>\r\n<li>Equals the # of U.S. Road Warriors with smartphones: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;= 9.5 million</li>\r\n<li>Multiply by the % that use location-based services: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; x 74% (<a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/2012/05/11/three-quarters-of-smartphone-owners-use-location-based-services/\" target=\"_blank\">Pew Research</a>)&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Equals the addressable market number of smartphone users: &nbsp; &nbsp; = 7.0 million</li>\r\n<li>Multiply by the price of the app: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;x $1.00/app</li>\r\n<li>Equals the Addressable Market size of: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; = $7.0 million</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Services Business Example:</strong></p>\r\n<p>For purposes of an easy-to-understand example, let's use a lawn mowing business.

Gross margin is also commonly referred to as Gross Profit and is usually expressed as a percentage as follows: (Net Sales Revenue - Direct Expenses) / Net Sales Revenue. Therefore, $100 of Net Sales Revenue with Direct Expenses of $50, results in a Gross M of 50%. Gross Margin is often measured on a unit of&nbsp;sales (unit Gross Margin) as well as a total Gross Margin for a given period.</p>", "Examples" : "<p><strong>Mobile App Opportunity Example:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Most mobile apps are sold in an app store with only one Direct Expense of a Revenue share of 30% to the app store owner such as Google or Apple. If so, the Gross Margin is generally 70% if the Gross Sales Revenue is booked, e.g. the total listed price of the app. However, if the Net Sales Revenue is booked because the app store collects the customer payment and then pays the mobile app company to Net Sales Revenue after the Revenue share is subtracted, then the Gross Margin is generally 100%.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Services Business Example:</strong></p>\r\n<p>To calculate the unit Gross Margin of a lawn mowing business, calculate the Gross Margin of each \"unit\" of service, or each mowing. If the average price is $30 per mowing and the Direct Expenses are $2 for gas and $13 of Direct Labor, then the unit Gross Margin is $15 or 50%.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Other Example Gross Margins:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Example opportunities with low Gross Margins: Any heavy manufacturing company with high labor and materials content, many of which struggle to achieve a Gross Margin above 25% - 35%</li>\r\n<li>Example opportunities with high Gross Margins: Software business models with very low content cost in terms of materials or labor and information services business models with highly automated processes that translate into low labor and materials content</li>\r\n</ul>", "Explanation" : "<p>When considering the Gross Margin, consider the following items:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Look at the average Gross Margin of peer companies or similar opportunities</li>\r\n<li>Calculate the Gross Margin of the historical financial results or the business plan</li>\r\n<li>Look for trends in overall Gross Margin as well as the Gross Margin by offering type to ascertain which offerings have the best and worst Gross Margin</li>\r\n<li>The mix of products and services in the overall offering will affect the overall average Gross Margin, i.e. if you sell more low Gross Margin items compared to high Gross Margin items in a particular period, your overall Gross Margin will decline&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Low Gross Margin businesses such as grocery and retail or distribution companies can still be nicely&nbsp;profitable if they have high \"velocity\" or a high number of inventory \"turns\" per year</li>\r\n</ul>", "Key Principle" : "What is the anticipated Gross Margin of the average offering?", "Why This Matters" : "<p>Opportunities with high Gross Margins will generally always perform better on all other financial metrics compared to opportunities with lower Gross Margins unless there are significant overhead or Indirect Expenses associated with the high Gross Margin business.

{ "Caution" : "", "Definition" : "<p>The type of customer relationship you are able to develop with your average customer ranging from&nbsp;a casual one-off, non-contractual relationship to a deeper contractual relationship to a committed, partner&nbsp;relationship.</p>", "Definition Of The Principle" : "", "Examples" : "<p><strong>Mobile App Opportunity Example:</strong></p>\r\n<p>The low-cost and convenient nature of searching for, buying, and downloading a mobile app means very few mobile apps will be able to achieve a multi-year, contractual recurring revenue relationship with customers. An except is a mobile app that is developed in partnership with a much larger software ecosystem with such contracts and the mobile app piggybacks on the longer-term contracts.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Business Services Example:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Using our lawn mowing business example, it is very rare for a household lawn mowing customer to&nbsp;sign a service contract, but it is highly likely that a commercial customer such as an office building or apartment&nbsp;complex to sign a multi-year service agreement with built-in pricing escalation.
